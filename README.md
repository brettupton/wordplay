## Overview

Linguistics has become a new hobby of mine and I wanted to explore that by creating it visually. A browser seemed like the naturally solution to me so I created a pseudo-site that features multiple different linguistical concepts. 

The primary way of interaction is by uploading a PDF, collecting tokens from the text, and showing off the features below.

## Features

- Frequency
- Markov Chains
- Phonetics
- More to come!
