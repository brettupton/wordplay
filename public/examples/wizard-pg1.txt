Only in silence the word,  only in dark the light,  only in dying life:  bright the hawk's flight on the empty sky.  -The Creation of Ea  ------  1 Warriors in the Mist  ------  The Island of Gont, a single mountain that lifts its peak a mile above the storm-  racked Northeast Sea, is a land famous for wizards. From the towns in its high valleys  and the ports on its dark narrow bays many a Gontishman has gone forth to serve the  Lords of the Archipelago in their cities as wizard or mage, or, looking for adventure, to  wander working magic from isle to isle of all Earthsea. Of these some say the greatest,  and surely the greatest voyager, was the man called Sparrowhawk, who in his day  became both dragonlord and Archmage. His life is told of in the Deed of Ged and in  many songs, but this is a tale of the time before his fame, before the songs were made.  He was born in a lonely village called Ten Alders, high on the mountain at the  head of the Northward Vale. Below the village the pastures and plowlands of the Vale  slope downward level below level towards the sea, and other towns lie on the bends of  the River Ar; above the village only forest rises ridge behind ridge to the stone and snow  of the heights.
